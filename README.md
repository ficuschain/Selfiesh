# Selfiesh
- SelFiesh is an android application that offers a solution to 2016 Fishackathon 1st Problem.
- You can find the problems in Presentation/2016 Fishackathon Final Problem Statements.pdf

- We have tested our application in Android API 22 & v 5.1.1 and it works perfectly without any errors.

- We have 5 fish in our database which are Bluefish, Seabass, Redmullet, Redporgy, BlueWhiting.
You will have the similarity ratio of your captured fish compared to our fish in database. We are able to add other fish but we had no sample photos, it is not a big deal.  
Please pay attention while trying to recognize other fish with our application.
